You will be given a short description from an Airbnb listing in Edinburgh. It may describe either:
- the property itself, or
- the surrounding neighbourhood.

Your task is to identify **places or locations described as being near** the property — for example, anything mentioned as a short walk away, close by, or nearby.

You should categorise all such places into three groups:

1. `specific_locations` — locations that are **named and mappable**, such as landmarks, parks, venues, or neighbourhood features (e.g. "The Meadows", "Ocean Terminal").
2. `general_locations` — vague or generic references to places that **are not named or are too broad to geocode**, such as "train station", "shops", or "city centre".
3. `parent_locations` — the neighbourhood or area where the property is located (e.g. "Marchmont", "Leith"). Do not include these in the other two categories unless the location is explicitly described as a separate nearby place. 

Correct minor spelling mistakes for named places (e.g. "Murayfield" -> "Murrayfield Stadium") so they match real map locations.

For `general_locations`, strip out descriptive words and articles (e.g. "the lively bars" -> "bars", "local shops" -> "shops")..

If a vague reference clearly refers to a specific place, correct it (e.g. "the castle" -> "Edinburgh Castle"). But only do this when the reference is **unambiguous**. For example, "the station" may refer to multiple locations and should remain general unless disambiguated in the text.

If a location is mentioned more than once, list it only once in the appropriate category.

Return your output in the following JSON format, marked "<|startofjson|>" and "<|endofjson|>" before and after the JSON block:

```
{
  "specific_locations": [...],
  "general_locations": [...],
  "parent_locations": [...],
}
```

Here are some examples of inputs and expected outputs. 

Example 1: Vague reference to specific location, reference to parent location.
Description:
"This bright flat in Marchmont is just a few minutes from the Meadows and near the university."

Output: 
```
{
  "specific_locations": ["The Meadows", "University of Edinburgh"],
  "general_locations": [],
  "parent_locations": ["Marchmont"]
}
```
Example 2: Vague reference to specific location, reference to parent location, spelling mistake (Lieth -> Leith).
Description:
"A cosy studio located in Lieth, just steps from The Shore and right beside Ocean Terminal. You're also a short bus ride from the city centre, and less than 30 mins from the airport by tram."

Output:
```
{
  "specific_locations": ["The Shore", "Ocean Terminal", "Edinburgh International Airport"],
  "general_locations": ["city centre"],
  "parent_locations":["Leith"]
}
```

Example 3: Vague references and adjectives.
Description:
"This cosy apartment is a few minutes’ walk from the station, is handy for local shops and has a great view of the castle."

Output:
```
{
  "specific_locations": ["Edinburgh Castle"],
  "general_locations": ["train station", "shops"],
  "parent_locations": []
}
```

Example 4: spelling mistake (Princess -> Princes), parent location, ambiguous wording, abbreviation (St -> Street). 
Description:
"Located on Market St, We're just a few minutes' walk from Princess Street, and handy for both the new and old town."

Output:
```
{
  "specific_locations": ["Princes Street", "New Town", "Old Town"],
  "general_locations": [],
  "parent_locations": ["Market Street"]
}
```

Example 5: No locations present.
Description:
“This conveniently located apartment features high ceilings, modern decor, and a fully equipped kitchen.”

Output:
```
{
  "specific_locations": [],
  "general_locations": [],
  "parent_locations": []
}
```

If you must reason, do so briefly, but always output **only a single JSON object and nothing else**.

Now try with the following property description:
